# Well-Up-ML
Project Title : Well Up

Project Supervisor: Haoyi Wang

## Project Vision

For those who wish to monitor their mood and improve their habits and mental health, Well Up is a wellness app that allows you to track your daily mood and wellness statistics. By collecting data from asking a user how their day was, and using sentiment analysis on that input, Well Up can offer a choice of moods that suit the user based on their input. Users can also record and track their daily habits to help improve their wellness. By also integrating with platforms such as Appleâ€™s HealthKit to monitor other statistics such as sleep data, Well Up can help users monitor their wellness and work to improve it. This data will be visualized for users for them to be able to see a summary of how their day or week is going.
